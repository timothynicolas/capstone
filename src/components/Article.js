            <p> Chess is a timeless strategy board game that originated in northern India over a thousand years ago. It's played on an 8x8 grid with 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player commands an army of 16 pieces, including a king, queen, bishops, knights, rooks, and pawns. The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position to be captured ('in check') and there is no way to move the king out of capture ('mate'). The game requires critical thinking, foresight, and strategic planning, making it a fascinating intellectual challenge enjoyed worldwide. It's not just a game; it's a rich tapestry of tactics and positional play.</p>
